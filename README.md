# Retrowave-Visualizer

Retrovave/synthwave style track visualization project. 

Made for my track "Radiant Reverie" ([youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cY6TkQKkNhU&ab_channel=cantbemyself)). 

So far we can't configure or customize anything without getting into the project itself, but I'm working on it.
